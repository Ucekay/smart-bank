# Package Installation Guidelines

## Use `bunx expo install` for Package Installation

When adding new packages to this Expo project, always use `bunx expo install` instead of `npm install` or `bun add`.

### Why Use `bunx expo install`?

1. **Expo Compatibility**: Ensures packages are compatible with your Expo SDK version
2. **Version Management**: Automatically resolves compatible versions for Expo modules
3. **Bun Integration**: Leverages Bun's fast package manager with Expo's compatibility checks
4. **Consistency**: Maintains consistency with the project's Bun-based setup

### Installation Commands

```bash
# ✅ Correct - Use bunx expo install
bunx expo install package-name

# ❌ Incorrect - Don't use these
npm install package-name
bun add package-name
yarn add package-name
```

### Examples

```bash
# Installing Expo modules
bunx expo install expo-camera
bunx expo install expo-location
bunx expo install expo-notifications

# Installing React Navigation
bunx expo install @react-navigation/native
bunx expo install @react-navigation/stack

# Installing third-party libraries
bunx expo install react-native-svg
bunx expo install react-native-gesture-handler
```

### Development Dependencies

For development dependencies, still use `bunx expo install`:

```bash
# Installing dev dependencies
bunx expo install --dev @types/react-native
bunx expo install --dev eslint-plugin-react-native
```

Remember: This project uses Bun as the package manager, so `bunx expo install` provides the best integration between Bun's speed and Expo's compatibility checks.
